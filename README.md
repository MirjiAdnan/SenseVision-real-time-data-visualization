# SenseVision-real-time-data-visualization

The project integrates LiDAR and camera streams into a real-time GUI. Built with Qt, OpenCV, and PCL, it provides a dynamic visualization system for vehicle perception, allowing users to view:
- Front Camera Feed (Real-time video streaming)
- Rear Camera Feed (Real-time video streaming)
- LiDAR Point Cloud (Embedded 3D visualization)
The GUI automatically adjusts the layout based on the selected sensors, ensuring an optimized viewing experience. Windows API integration allows seamless embedding of the LiDAR console application inside the GUI window. 
This system is ideal for autonomous driving applications, ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), and real-time vehicle perception research.
